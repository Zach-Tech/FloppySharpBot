You will need:
- Developer Token
- A Server (Discord)
- Self-Hosting (Easy)
- A Discord account
- Watch my YT video ahead of time.
________________________________________________

Step 1.)

Either download, or open Discord in a browser. (likely easier on browser)

- Open a second tab
	-  Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and start a new application, name it something unique
		- Make it a Bot Application
			- Copy that Token to **Floppy.cs line 39**

Step 2.)

Be sure that:
- Presence
- Public
- Server
Intents are checked.

This has to do with a recent change (28th of October, 2020 in fact) wherein Discord now requires Developers
to declare what sort of information they require (or aquire) for their bot operate.

It's easier for a small fry like myself to just enable it at the start, (not enabling it is referred to as privileged)
rather than trudge through Documentation to ensure i'm doing it all correctly.

Step 3.)

Head to OAuth2 and craft your bot invitation
	- Select bot
	- Have a discord server ready, or join the one I provided (https://discord.gg/deVUJ63MHn)
		- if you're already signed in, select a server and the bot will be invited to that server.


Step 4.)

	Provide the bot an administrator role:

	- Click server name > Server Settings > Roles > Click the (+) symbol > Name the Role > Click Administrator under General Permissions > Save.

Step 5.)

	Use the help command!
